- **Standing Order Display**: Visual display of choir arrangement by section
- **Position Control**: Move members up/down within their sections
- **Data Persistence**: localStorage for client-side data storage
- **Import/Export**: JSON-based backup and restore functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop-friendly interface
- **AWS Deployment**: CloudFront CDN distribution with S3 hosting

## 🏗️ Project Structure

This is a Yarn workspaces monorepo with two packages:

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Yarn package manager
- AWS CLI configured (for deployment)
- AWS CDK CLI (for deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd choir-seating-manager
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

This will install dependencies for all packages in the monorepo.

## 💻 Development

### Running the Website Locally

```bash
# Start development server
yarn dev

# The app will be available at http://localhost:5173
```

### Building the Website

```bash
# Build for production
yarn build

# Preview production build
yarn preview
```

## ☁️ AWS Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. Configure AWS credentials:
```bash
aws configure
```

2. Bootstrap CDK (first time only):
```bash
cd packages/infrastructure
npx cdk bootstrap
```

### Deploy to AWS

```bash
# From project root - builds website and deploys infrastructure
yarn deploy
```

This command will:
1. Build the React website
2. Deploy the CDK stack (S3 bucket + CloudFront distribution)
3. Upload the built website to S3
4. Invalidate CloudFront cache

After deployment, the CloudFront URL will be displayed in the terminal output.

### CDK Commands

```bash
# From project root
yarn cdk synth    # Synthesize CloudFormation template
yarn cdk diff     # Show changes to be deployed
yarn cdk deploy   # Deploy the stack
```

## 🎨 Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18**: UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **Vite**: Fast build tool
- **SCSS**: Styling with variables and nesting
- **localStorage**: Client-side data persistence

### AWS Infrastructure
- **S3**: Static website hosting
- **CloudFront**: Global CDN for fast content delivery
- **Origin Access Identity**: Secure S3 access
- **AWS CDK**: Infrastructure as Code in TypeScript

## 📝 Usage

### Adding Choir Members

1. Enter member name
2. Select voice section (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass)
3. Click "Add Member"

### Managing Standing Order

- **Move Up/Down**: Use arrow buttons to adjust position within section
- **Remove**: Click × to remove a member
- **Export Data**: Save current configuration as JSON file
- **Import Data**: Load previously saved configuration

### Data Format

The application uses a simple JSON format for data import/export:

```json
{
  "members": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "name": "Member Name",
      "voiceSection": "Soprano",
      "position": 0
    }
  ],
  "lastUpdated": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customizing Colors

Edit `packages/website/src/styles/variables.scss` to customize:
- Voice section colors
- Primary/secondary colors
- Spacing and layout

### CDK Stack Customization

Edit `packages/infrastructure/lib/website-stack.ts` to:
- Change S3 bucket name
- Add custom domain with Route53
- Configure CloudFront cache policies
- Add SSL certificates

## 🧪 Future Enhancements

Potential features for future development:

- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito integration for user management
- **Backend API**: Lambda + API Gateway for server-side data storage
- **Database**: DynamoDB or RDS for persistent storage
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for collaborative editing
- **Advanced Ordering**: Drag-and-drop reordering
- **Print Layout**: Optimized view for printing standing orders
- **Multiple Choirs**: Support for managing multiple choir groups
